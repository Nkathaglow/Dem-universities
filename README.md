## Project Description

**
GET request("fetch") accesses data from the link.The response.json we want to get a response to convert data to a JSON object.The data for each gathers data from each university and iterates over each university in my API.It is then processed by creating HTML elements for each university and appends them to the DOM.It then catches any errors and logged to the console.The chat pop-up gives access to allow it to open and close and receives responses.Several event listeners are used on here to act as buttons when clicked.Though the response is entirely dependent on the content of the chat.Basically my code demonstrates how to fetch data from a server,parses the data,dynamically creates and appends HTML elements to display on the webpage.
